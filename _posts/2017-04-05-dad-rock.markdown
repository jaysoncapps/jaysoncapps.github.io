Over the last couple of years I've been jamming with my neighbor and fellow dad, Sterling. It has been a blast. Usually, Stirling will play acoustic guitar and sing. My main role has just been coming up with guitar riffs. After weeks of sending each other videos and audio files through Google Drive we get an idea of song structure. Then we usually get together and hammer out a more solid song. Once we feel comfortable enough, we will begin the recoding process. 

Just two dudes playing music in laundry room or garage.  

The result can be found below. Fun times for sure.
